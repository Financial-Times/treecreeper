SystemLifecycle:
  description: |
    The lifecycle stage of a system.
    Note that 'Deprecated' should be used for systems that are currently
    not actively used, but may not be fully decommissioned yet
  options:
    Preproduction: |
      Not yet ready for use. May be unstable, subject to unannounced changes,
      or not yet fully built.
    Production: |
      Ready for use by its intended users, and supported appropriately.
    Deprecated: |
      In the process of being replaced or retired. May still be functional,
      but should not be added as a new dependency to systems.
    Discontinued: |
      No longer functional. Attempts to interact with the system will be unsuccessful.
    Decommissioned: |
      For a self hosted/installed system, all its parts have been removed from all the environments it ran in.
      For SaaS, we no longer pay for or have the ability to use the system.
