    # Automatic Chasing Email
    # This is an auto-generated email sent from the GDPR Hub to System Owners,
    # instructing them to erasure data for an individual. System owners who need
    # to do deletions manually will receive this message. The email contains a
    # link which the individual can click to confirm the fact they have deleted
    # data. Weekly reminders will be sent until deletion has been confirmed.
    # ACE
    - value: AutomaticChasingEmail
      description: AutomaticChasingEmail description placeholder
    # Deletion Table
    # This is a table of people who need to be deleted, either due to retention
    # policy or someone having submitted a request. It is maintained in Data
    # Platform and populated when they are deleted in Membership. Some
    # downstream systems either consume a feed from the table or poll it and
    # delete any new records found since last accessed.
    # DT
    - value: DeletionTable
      description: DeletionTable description placeholder
    # Automatic routine
    # This means the system has an automatic purge routine in place which
    # deletes data older than a specified time. The time varies by system but
    # should not be longer than 30 days as this is the length of time we have
    # to fulfil a deletion request. With auto delete routines there is no
    # requirement to do anything else to implement retention policy and system
    # owners dont need to be notified of erasure requests.
    # Auto
    - value: ScheduledPurge
      description: ScheduledPurge description placeholder
    # Manual
    # This means there is no automated routine in place for deletions. For
    # erasure requests, these system owners will receive an ACE message, but
    # for retention, they will need to set a manual trigger and delete data
    # periodically to remain compliant.
    - value: Manual
      description: Manual description placeholder
    # Application Programming Interface
    # Some systems have APIs which are called directly by the Hub. These are
    # called for erasure requests only as retention is not (currently) managed
    # in the Hub.

      description: Multiple description placeholder
    # N/A
    # Some systems are considered too complex to complete erasure/ retention on,
    # so it was decided to not implement standard policy on these systems. The

    # Compliance teams, but they are marked as n/a here.
