    Functionality: |
      These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user
      name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal
      features. For instance, a website may be able to provide you with local weather
      reports or traffic news by storing in a cookie the region in which you are
      currently located. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have
      made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise.
      They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching
      a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be
