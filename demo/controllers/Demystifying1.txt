1. Design the additions to the schema
	- what data do you have?
	- what is lists, what is objects
	- GraphQL model doesn't have to be structured the same as what comes from the API - can preprocess
	- What types/extensions do we need
	- If you find you want to connect the data to lots of different records in Biz Ops, maybe syncing the data into the Biz Ops database is better



extend type System {
	healthcheckData: [Healthcheck]
}

type Healthcheck {
	value: Float
	label: String
	severity: Int
}
